# Remote-Controlled-Mecanum-Wheel-Car
Arduino Based Remote Controlled Mecanum Wheel Car. This mecanum wheel car uses four 3-6V TT DC Gearbox Motors, two L298N motor controllers to control the velocity of the wheels, and two NRF24L01 Transceivers for remote control.

Current Functions:
1. Omni-Direction Moving
2. Rotate
3. Remote Controllable

Future Improvements
1. Use encoders and IMU for PID control
2. Integrate into STM32
